# CSUCapstone

This is my final project for CSU Gloabl

## Project Overview

This project will first take responses from a Google Forms Survay

[HERE IS THE GOOGLE SURVAY](https://forms.gle/A6QcZTDptSNuhZeeA)

The results from that survay are then stored into an SQL database that is hosted on AWS RDS

The data from there is then displayed using Plotly
