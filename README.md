# CSUCapstone

This is my final project for CSU Gloabl

## Project Overview

This project will first take responses from a Google Forms Survay

[HERE IS THE GOOGLE SURVAY](https://forms.gle/A6QcZTDptSNuhZeeA)

The results from that survay are then stored into an SQL database that is hosted on AWS RDS

The data from there is then displayed using Plotly

## What the Files do

### app.py

This is the main file 

It has the Plotly and Dash code

It aslo calls to start the other files

### client_secrets.json

This is a file with Google API log-in information

I have removed all of the content from it

### database.py

### find.py

### forms.py

### results.json

### token.json
